The <a href=package-summary.html>&lt;Unnamed&gt;</a> package is used startup
and configure the server.<p>

The <a href=http://java.net/projects/cajo/pages/Home>cajo SDK</a> is used for
transparent distributed computing between remote Java Virtual Machines,
providing client user interfaces via Applets and WebStart. Through the cajo
<a href=http://weblogs.java.net/blog/cajo/archive/2007/09/simple_interjvm.htm>
grail</a> mechanism, {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractService services} can dynamically
discover and use each other, by specified functionality. Also, via the cajo
<a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/server.html>CodebaseServer</a> mechanism;
rich distributed user interfaces to the service objects can be provided,
services can also provide {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractController controller}
objectst to themselves, and services can send {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractAgent
agent} objects to other services for themselves. Full cajo framework <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/index.html>
Javadoc</a> is available, as is an <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/sdk.html>
introductory overview.</a><p>

The intended use of this SDK is as a <i>'starting point'</i> for new
projects. Feel free to overwrite it, and add classes to it, and when you are
ready to create another server, simply start with an original copy of the
SDK again. Later, if you wish to take advantage of some of the more advanced
features of the full cajo library, simply replace grail.jar with cajo.jar.
The grail.jar library is a proper subset of cajo.jar.<p>

The <a href=http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/200l7/04/24/top-50-john-catherino-project-cajo-interview.html>
cajo grail framework</a> allows Java Virtual Machines to dynamically
distribute their functionality, and user interfaces, across the network
transparently. It essentially creates a <i>seamless continuum</i> between
cooperating remote Java Virtual Machines, or in other words, a <a href=http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/1715>
World Wide Virtual Machine</a>. <i>(wwvm)</i> The classes defined in this
SDK, along with the included <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/Cajo.html>
Cajo</a> object, can provide full functional completeness. A single JVM can
furnish more than one service/controller/view combination, if it wishes.<p>

An overview of the fundamental architecture:<p>

<center><img src="../SDK.png" title="cajo sdk architecture diagramme"></center><p>

A typical cajo server deployment consists minimally of the following nine files:<ul>

 <li> <b>grail.jar</b> - the standard cajo grail library
 <li> <b>server.jar</b> - the implementation(s) of the service(s), and optional main application
 <li> <b>controller.jar</b> - the <i>hot swappable</i> implementation(s) of the controler(s), and optional view(s)
 <li> <b>agent.jar</b> - the <i>hot swappable</i> implementation(s) of the agent(s)
 <li> <b>client.jar</b> - the standard cajo controller view GUI viewer
 <li> <b>favicon.ico</b> - to give the Applet a little style
 <li> <b>splash.jpeg</b> - to give the WebStart app a little style (gif or png too)
 <li> <b>icon.gif</b> - to provide the WebStart app its own icon  (png or jpeg too)
 <li> <b>server.policy</b> - a security policy for the server JVM<br><br>
 <li> <i>optionally,</i> any other library jars needed by either controllers, or services.*</ul>

<p>A <i>hot-swappable</i> controller and agent jar means that new user
interfaces, controllers, and agents can be developed for currently running
services. Simply overwriting the jar file will cause all subsequent clients
to use the <i>new</i> controllers/views/agents.

<p>*The optional CodebaseServer utility class can be used to send any mobile
code .jar files, for agents and controllers, from its immediate
subdirectories, with the notable exception of server.jar. Jars used only by
the server are conventionally renamed with the .zip extension, to stop
CodebaseServer from sending them. The .zip and .jar file formats are identical
as far as the Java runtime environment is concerned.<p>

To view the service client in a full-browser Java Applet, visit the
http service, e.g. <tt>http://myhost:port/name</tt> (name being replaced
by the actual name of the service to be used)<p>

The application can also be started via WebStart by visiting the server
thusly: <tt>http://myhost:port/name!</tt> (note the addition of the
exclamation mark!) Following the WebStart launch, the system will ask if you
wish a shortcut icon placed on the desktop. If yes, clicking on this icon can
be used for all subsequent client application launches for that service.<p>

For highest performance, the client can be run as a standard Java application,
via the following invocation:<p>

<tt>java -cp client.jar:grail.jar -Djava.security.manager
-Djava.security.policy=client.policy cajo.sdk.Client //myhost:port/name</tt><br>
<i>(replace : with ; for windows users)</i><p>

<u>Notes from a network perspective</u>:<ul>
 <li> Servers need to have <u>two</u> open inbound ports <i>(typically 80
      and 1196)</i> The first is optional, and only needed if the service
      is furnishing controllers, agents, or other mobile code classes.
 <li> Clients can operate with <u>all</u> of their inbound ports closed
 <li> Servers <i>and</i> clients both can be behind NAT routers
</ul><p>

The grail.jar library also contains three commonly used cajo classes, not
demonstrated in the SDK example:<p><ul>

<li><a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/ItemProxy.html>
ItemProxy</a> and <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/ClientProxy.html>
ClientProxy</a>, these are used to allow callback method invocations to JVMs
which are <a href=http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/FirewalledClients>
firewalled</a>.

<li><a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/Xfile.html>
Xfile</a> is used to pass files between JVMs.
</ul>
