The &lt;Unnamed&gt; package contains the main {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractServer
server} definition.<p>

A server is a JVM which furnishes one or more {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractService
service} objects. It can also optionally, have a main executable program as
well. Typically, many light-load services are grouped in a JVM, whilst fewer
heavier-load services are grouped into a single JVM.

<p><b>Design Recommendation:</b> <i>(found to work very well)</i><ol>

<li>Subclass {@link cajo.sdk.IService IService}, and well document method
functionality. Be sure to fully document the service package.html with as
much detail. Consider the generated javadoc as being the only documentation
a user of the services should need.

<li>Subclass {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractService AbstractService} into
MockService(s), providing simple/trivial implementations of the methods. This
will provide a fully demonstrable system, very quickly.

<li>Subclass the MockService(s) into ActualService(s) implementing method
functionality iteratively, with an eye toward always being able to
demonstrate at any stage of development.

</ol>

Do similarly for Agents and Controllers.<p>

For a distributed system, more useful than unit tests; develop test services,
or even <a href=http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/CajoScripting>
scripts</a>, of functional test scenarios.<p>

Applications become increasingly flexible and powerful, the more
<i>Interfaces,</i> rather than <i>Objects</i> are used, for non-primitive
arguments and return types.<p>

Over time, should service functionality requirements increase; subclass the
previous service, to provide the additional methods. This incurs no impact on
existing service clients, whilst allowing updated clients to access the new
functionality.
