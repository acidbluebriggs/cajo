This package contains {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractController controller}
definitions for {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractService service} objects. A service
can furnish as many controllers as it wishes, normally one, even none at all.
A controller can also optionally support a GUI {@link cajo.sdk.AbstractView
View}.
