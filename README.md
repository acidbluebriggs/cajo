cajo
====

Cajo is a very simple way to have two JVM's communicate across
a local area network.

Cajo was written by John Catherino who died in 2016 without designating 
a future maintainer.  Thorbj√∏rn Ravn Andersen used Cajo for internal 
development in a previous job and mavenized it and added a copy
of the java.net resources when it went dark.  In 2018 he needed this
for a simpler-than-multipart-REST-services feature, so decided
to clean the project up and get it on Maven Central.
